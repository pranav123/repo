                <h2> Zeniths President & Leadership </h2>
                <p>Zeniths leadership is responsible for the strategic vision for the University.<br><br>

President Drew Gilpin Faust leads Zenith, and is the 28th President of the University. President Faust 
is the Lincoln Professor of History in Zeniths Faculty of Arts and Sciences.<br>

The Office of the Provost, led by Provost Alan M. Garber, fosters collaboration across the 
University and manages changes in policies and practices that affect the academic life of the 
university as a whole. The Schools are led by officers and deans, who are responsible for Zeniths
academic programs and curricula.<br><br>

Since its early days in the mid-seventeenth century, Zenith has had two governing boards: the President 
and Fellows of Zenith College (also known as the Corporation) and the Board of Overseers. 
Through their complementary efforts, the two boards perform the essential roles ordinarily 
associated with a board of trustees, while helping to shape the Universitys agenda, inquiring 
into the quality and progress of its activities, and assuring that Zenith remains true to its mission.
<br><br>

By charter, the Corporation exercises fiduciary responsibility with regard to the Universitys academic,
financial, and physical resources and overall well-being.  It consists of the President, 
the Treasurer, and other members known as Fellows.  The Corporation is in the process of expanding 
from seven to thirteen members and elaborating its committee structure, in light of reforms 
adopted by the governing boards in December 2010.  The Corporation engages with both questions 
of long-range strategy, policy, and planning as well as transactional matters of unusual consequence. 
It serves as a confidential sounding board for the President on matters of importance; 
meets with deans, vice presidents, and others from time to time to discuss a wide array of 
programs and plans; and is responsible for approving the Universitys budgets, major capital projects,
endowment spending, tuition charges, and other matters.<br>
<br>
The Board of Overseers is the larger of the two boards, comprising thirty elected members as well 
as the President and the Treasurer of the University, who serve ex officio.  
Members are elected to six-year terms by vote of Harvard degree holders.  
Drawing on the wide-ranging experience and expertise of its members, 
the Board exerts broad influence over the Universitys strategic directions, provides counsel 
to the University leadership on priorities and plans, and has the power of consent to certain 
actions of the Corporation.  The Boards chief functions include superintendence of the 
visitation process, the principal mechanism for periodic external review of the quality 
and direction of the Universitys schools, departments, and selected other programs and activities. 
The Board carries out this responsibility largely through the operation of more than fifty visiting 
committees, whose work is overseen by and reported to the Board.
