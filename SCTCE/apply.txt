All prospective graduate students apply to SEAS through the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS).
Students with bachelor's degrees in the natural sciences, mathematics, or engineering are invited to apply for admission. Applications from minorities and women are particularly welcome. All students admitted to our Ph.D. program receive full financial support. This includes tuition, fees, and a cost-of living stipend.
In considering applicants, the Zenith Admissions Committee uses selection criteria aimed at admitting a class that represents a wide range of academic interests, personal experiences and aspirations, and diversity in age, gender, religion, geographic region, race and ethnicity, and academic background.
We are delighted that you are interested in learning more about joining this vibrant academic community that prepares students for lives of leadership, ministry, and scholarship.
