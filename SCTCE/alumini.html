                <p> <i>The Zenith University Alumni Association is made up of more than 35,000 alumni who live 
                    in every state and in countries around the world. Everyone who graduates from Zenith is automatically 
                    a member of the Association. There are no dues or no special requirements, but a variety of benefits 
                    and resources available to all of our alumni.</i><br><br>

We encourage everyone to be actively involved in the Association by letting us know where you are and what you are doing, 
returning to campus for reunions and special events, participating in alumni events in your area, and sharing your time, 
talent and expertise with the Center for Student Engagement and Office of Admission.<br>

The Association is governed by the Alumni Association Board of Directors who are selected to represent our diverse alumni base. 
The Office of Alumni Engagement oversees the Alumni Association and the Alumni Board of Directors and is responsible for 
carrying out all alumni-related activities.</p>
